This is a my owned machine learning model.
The machine learning models will include 
* Linear Regression
* logistics Regression
* KNN
* K-Mean
* Decision Tree

More and more ML models will be continuously updated and added. 

All the models will be followed the template below. Each ML models mainly have the three of the following components. 
1. Prediction model: formular to do the prediction.
2. Cost/Loss function: the technique of evaluating "the performance of the algorithm/model"
3. Optimization algorithm: a procedure which is executed iteratively to find the optimum and minimize the cost function.
